# Contributing

Before submitting feedback, please familiarize yourself with our current issues
list and review the [working group
documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/acme/documents/) and [mailing
list discussion](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/acme/). If you're
new to this, you may also want to read the [Tao of the
IETF](https://www.ietf.org/tao.html).

Be aware that all contributions to the specification fall under the "NOTE WELL"
terms outlined below.

1. The best way to provide feedback (editorial or design) and ask questions is
sending an e-mail to our mailing list
([info](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/acme)). This will ensure that
the entire Working Group sees your input in a timely fashion.

2. If you have **editorial** suggestions (i.e., those that do not change the
meaning of the specification), you can either:

  a) Fork this repository and submit a pull request; this is the lowest
  friction way to get editorial changes in.

  b) Submit a new issue to GitHub, and mention that you believe it is editorial
  in the issue body. It is not necessary to notify the mailing list for
  editorial issues.

  c) Make comments on individual commits in GitHub. Note that this feedback is
  processed only with best effort by the editors, so it should only be used for
  quick editorial suggestions or questions.

3. For non-editorial (i.e., **design**) issues, you can also create an issue on
GitHub. However, you **must notify the mailing list** when creating such issues,
providing a link to the issue in the message body.

  Note that **github issues are not for substantial discussions**; the only
  appropriate place to discuss design issues is on the mailing list itself.


## NOTE WELL
