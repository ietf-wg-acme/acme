Whenever there's a single hostname we prefer the `www` variant because the prefix makes it easier to quickly distinguish from `example.com`. When there are two hostnames we use both `www.example.org` and `example.org`.\r\n\r\nSince we already used one order ID consistently through the doc, I made sure that its identifiers, notBefore, and notAfter were always the same. I tweaked the \"expires\" so it would be in a reasonable range (not precisely equal to the notBefore). Note that the \"pending\" version of the order has a slightly different expires than the \"valid\" order.\r\n\r\nOne version of the finalized order had a cert ID of jWCdfHVGY2M and another had mAt3xBGaobw. Harmonized on mAt3xBGaobw since it was also used in the certificate retrieval example.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed an accidentally duplicated nonce."

They\r\n  have incompatible requirements: MUST NOT use MAC vs MUST use MAC.\r\n- Clarify that Replay-Nonce is an HTTP header field since it's defined\r\n  near JWS header parameters.\r\n- Don't include \"wildcard\": false in examples. Section 7.1.4 requires\r\n  that it MUST be absent when false.\r\n- There was lingering language in the Section 7.5.1 about \"updating\"\r\n  an authorization body in response to fields in a challenge POST.\r\n  Since the challenge POST is now described explicitly as \"an empty\r\n  JSON body\", this language didn't make sense.

'_If the order indicated does not have status \"ready\" ... the problem document returned by the server SHOULD use error code \"badCSR\"_'.\r\n2. '_A request to finalize an order will return the order to be finalized.  The client should begin polling the order by sending a POST-as-GET request to the order resource to obtain its current state.  The status of the order will indicate what action the client should take:_', where values other than \"ready\" are listed.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to resolve this conflict by requiring servers to return a new 'badState' error in response to a request to finalize an order that is not in the \"ready\" state.  The client should respond to a \"badState\" error by re-fetching the order object and examining the status field to determine what to do.\r\n"

If new fields are specified in the future,\r\n   the specification of those fields MUST describe whether they can be\r\n   provided by the client.\r\n\r\n   In general, the server MUST ignore any fields in the request object\r\n   that it does not recognize.  In particular, it MUST NOT reflect\r\n   unrecognized fields in the resulting account object.  This allows\r\n   clients to detect when servers do not support an extension field.\r\n```\r\n\"MUST ignore...in account bodies sent by the client...any other fields that it does not recognize\" in the first paragraph seems to be unnecessarily repeated by \"MUST ignore any fields in the request object that it does not recognize\" in the second paragraph.  This PR merges these two paragraphs and discards the duplicated text.\r\n\r\nAlso, \"account bodies\" isn't used anywhere else in the document, so this PR changes it to \"account objects\"."

    "body": "ACME (draft-14, August 2018)\r\n```\r\n11.4.  Malformed Certificate Chains\r\n\r\n   ACME provides certificate chains in the widely-used format known\r\n   colloquially as PEM (though it may diverge from the actual Privacy\r\n   Enhanced Mail specifications [RFC1421], as noted in [RFC7468]).  Some\r\n   current software will allow the configuration of a private key and a\r\n   certificate in one PEM file, by concatenating the textual encodings\r\n   of the two objects.  In the context of ACME, such software might be\r\n   vulnerable to \"key replacement\" attacks.  A malicious ACME server\r\n   could cause a client to use a private key of its choosing by\r\n   including the key in the PEM file returned in response to a query for\r\n   a certificate URL.\r\n   \r\n   When processing an file of type \"application/pem-certificate-chain\",\r\n   a client SHOULD verify that the file contains only encoded\r\n   certificates.  If anything other than a certificate is found (i.e.,\r\n   if the string \"-----BEGIN\" is ever followed by anything other than\r\n   \"CERTIFICATE\"), then the client MUST reject the file as invalid.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMHO this is a bit unclear, because RFC7468 (April 2015) allows \"Explanatory Text\".\r\n\r\nRFC7468 (April 2015)\r\n```\r\n5.2.  Explanatory Text\r\n\r\n   Many tools are known to emit explanatory text before the BEGIN and\r\n   after the END lines for PKIX certificates, more than any other type.\r\n   If emitted, such text SHOULD be related to the certificate, such as\r\n   providing a textual representation of key data elements in the\r\n   certificate.\r\n   \r\nSubject: CN=Atlantis\r\nIssuer: CN=Atlantis\r\nValidity: from 7/9/2012 3:10:38 AM UTC to 7/9/2013 3:10:37 AM UTC\r\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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\r\nILwpnZ1izL4MlI9eCSHhVQBHEp2uQdXJB+d5Byg=\r\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be made clear if \"Explanatory Text\" is allowed in ACME or not."

(e.g.  shred/acme4j#53)\r\n\r\nIf one of the authorizations fails a challenge validation operation the\r\nclient can't know whether it was the \"example.com\" validation, or the\r\n\"*.example.com\" validation that failed and won't be able to prompt the\r\nuser to retry with the failed domain removed. Generally speaking it\r\nmakes presenting accurate error information difficult without\r\nover-fitting Let's Encrypt's particular Wildcard issuance policies.\r\n(E.g. see discussion in\r\nhttps://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/5620#issuecomment-369111947 and\r\nhttps://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/5613#issuecomment-368097551)\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces an optional boolean authorization field that can\r\nbe used to indicate the authorization's identifier should be considered\r\nthe base domain of a wildcard identifier that was requested.\r\n\r\nThis replaces #402, which included the baggage of #401."

Imagine\r\na situation where a user requests a new order with the following\r\nrequest body:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"identifiers\": [\r\n    { \"type\": \"dns\", \"value\": \"example.com\" },\r\n    { \"type\": \"dns\", \"value\": \"*.example.com\" }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt's possible two authorizations will be created for this case, but both\r\nwill contain the identifier `{ \"type\":\"dns\", \"value\": \"example.com\"}`.\r\nThis can be confusing to users! (e.g.  shred/acme4j#53)\r\n\r\nIf one of the authorizations fails a challenge validation operation the\r\nclient can't know whether it was the \"example.com\" validation, or the\r\n\"*.example.com\" validation that failed and won't be able to prompt the\r\nuser to retry with the failed domain removed. Generally speaking it\r\nmakes presenting accurate error information difficult without\r\nover-fitting Let's Encrypt's particular Wildcard issuance policies.\r\n(E.g. see discussion in https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/5620#issuecomment-369111947 and \r\nhttps://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/5613#issuecomment-368097551)\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces an optional boolean authorization field that can\r\nbe used to indicate the authorization's identifier should be considered\r\nthe base domain of a wildcard identifier that was requested.\r\n\r\n**Note to reviewers: This builds on top of #401 and only 050474a is new\r\ncontent.**"

It doesn't include converting between serializations, or how to handle inner JWS messages.  \r\n\r\nIn short, this change should be a cleaner version of #382 that still allows the compact serialization. \r\n\r\n# What the Pull Request Includes\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this change requires ACME implementations to use the HTTP Content-Type header to indicate the JWS serialization format used for the request body. The change also specifies restrictions on the specific serialization formats when used with ACME (don't use unencoded payloads, don't use detached payloads, don't use unprotected headers). In addition, the change prohibits multiple signatures in JWS objects used for ACME purposes. \r\n\r\n# What the Pull Request Doesn't Include\r\n\r\n## Converting between JWS Serializations\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't include advice on how to convert between the JWS serializations. Converting between JWS serializations may be needed if, for example, an ACME implementation uses a JWS library that doesn't support all JWS serializations and/or doesn't provide programmers with control over what JWS serialization is produced. In such cases, programmers may have to convert between JWS serializations before and/or after using said pre-existing JWS library. \r\n\r\nI have started a draft of a separate JOSE serialization conversion guide at https://github.com/uhhhh2/jwe-jws-serialization-conversion-guide. The separate conversion guide is designed to not be ACME-specific. Accordingly, the separate conversion guide includes things like unencoded payloads, detached payloads, unprotected headers, and JWEs. \r\n\r\n## Applying the Serialization Requirements to A Nested JWS \r\n\r\nOne thing that is not included in this change is how the serialization format requirements should be applied to a \"nested\" JWS like the one found in a key change or an external account binding. Should a \"nested\" JWS be required to use the same serialization as the \"outer\" JWS? \r\n\r\nIf a nested JWS should follow the outer JWS serialization format, the following additional changes may need to be made:\r\n 1. Change the new \"JWS Serialization Formats\" section (introduced in this pull request). For example, the list in that section could be changed to the following: \r\n    - Content-Type \"application/jose\":\r\n      - A JWS of this Content-Type MUST meet the following criteria:\r\n        - The JWS Compact Serialization {{!RFC7515}} MUST be used. \r\n        - The JWS Payload MUST NOT be detached. \r\n        - The JWS Unencoded Payload Option {{!RFC7797}} MUST NOT be used. \r\n      - A JWS placed anywhere inside the payload of a JWS of this Content-Type MUST meet the above criteria as well. \r\n    - Content-Type \"application/jose+json\":\r\n      - A JWS of this Content-Type MUST meet the following criteria:\r\n         - Either the JWS Flattened JSON {{!RFC7515}} or the JWS General JSON {{!RFC7515}} Serialization MUST be used. \r\n         - The JWS Payload MUST NOT be detached. \r\n         - The JWS Unencoded Payload Option {{!RFC7797}} MUST NOT be used.\r\n         - The JWS Unprotected Header {{!RFC7515}} SHOULD NOT be used. \r\n      - A JWS placed anywhere inside the payload of a JWS of this Content-Type MUST meet the above criteria as well. \r\n 2. Update the specifications for the nested JWS: \r\n     - Right now, \"externalAccountBinding\" can be an object. If this JWS must follow the same guidelines as the outer JWS, \"externalAccountBinding\" could be an \"object or string\", depending on whether a JSON or compact serialization is used. \r\n    - If I understand correctly, the payload of the outer JWS for the \"keyChange\" (Account Key Roll-Over) endpoint is not a JSON object like in the other ACME requests. Instead, the payload for the \"outer\" JWS for this endpoint is merely this nested JWS itself. If this understanding is correct, I don't think any changes have to be made. If this understanding is not correct, I am not sure what changes may have to be made. "

    "body": "In #342, we moved the CSR from the new-order request to a \"finalize\" request.  In making that change, we dropped support for certain legacy back-end APIs that require a CSR before issuing challenges.  If we want to support those back-ends, we will need to re-enable sending CSR in new-order.  It seems like there are basically three things to define here:\r\n\r\n1. Add a flag in `dictionary.meta` to indicate that a CSR is required in new-order\r\n2. Re-add \"csr\" as a field in the new-order request and order objects\r\n3. Add an error code that indicates that a CSR was required in a new-order request\r\n\r\nThese features are cleanly enough separated that they can probably be handled in a small extension spec if there is a need for them."

This commit removes the \"tel\" contacts from the examples.

She has a certificate issued for bob.example and mallory.example. When Bob regains access to bob.example, he cannot revoke Mallory's certificate, as Mallory has erased the copy of the account and certificate keys on Bob's server (or she generated them on her own server).

    "body": "With the announcement of LetsEncrypt supporting wildcard certificates in ACMEv2, this change will lead to a new set of problems.  Primarily that once a wildcard certificate is requested, that certificate may need to be distributed to multiple servers as not all subdomains are likely to run on the same server.  To a lesser extent, this problem already exists for load-balancers.  To prevent hacky, insecure schemes that are likely to crop up with users trying to automate certificate sharing between their servers, I believe that it would be prudent for the ACMEv2 protocol to provide a mechanism for grabbing the previously issued cert on multiple machines.  Here is my suggestion for accomplishing this:\r\n\r\n1) Allow the primary server (the one which DNS points to for the primary domain), to submit a properly lengthy \"password\" (this could also be a privately generated SSL cert) with requests for a wildcard certificate.   This feature would be optional and not required.\r\n2) The other, subdomain servers, would then request the same wildcard certificate, with the same email address, and pass the same password or cert.  In this scenario, the protocol will not perform the usual domain validation, or will perform a weaker variant (validate that the server is at least a subdomain of the wildcard cert that is requested).\r\n3) Providing that the password/cert and the email address match what is on file, return the currently-valid wildcard certificate.\r\n\r\nThis feature will allow subdomain servers to grab the correct SSL cert without needing to resort to one-off certificate sharing solutions that are likely to result in insecure server configurations that might allow an attacker that compromised one host to move to other hosts."

Since\r\n>   updates with trivial payload should be used for account information,\r\n>   it seems to be expected that an account object is returned. The\r\n>   specified response status for \"Account deactivation\" is \"200 OK\".\r\n>   It would be consistent to specify the same response status for\r\n>   account updates I guess?\r\n> \r\n> 2.\r\n>   The client should be able to choose between \"Account URI recovery\"\r\n>   and \"Account Creation\", if needed. A possible way would be to clarify\r\n>   that account creations with trivial payload MUST be rejected. However,\r\n>   if an account exists, the \"Content-Location\" header and \"200 OK\" is\r\n>   returned, independent of the payloads content. Therefore a trivial\r\n>   payload could be used to check if an account with the used key exists,\r\n>   without creating it.\r\n> \r\n> 3.\r\n>   As \"6.3.4.  Account deactivation\", other queries should get their own\r\n>   sub-sub sections. Something like\r\n>    - \"6.3.x Account URI recovery\" (\"new-account\", maybe trivial payload)\r\n>    - \"6.3.x Account update\"\r\n>    - \"6.3.x Account information\" (update with trivial payload)\r\n"

These clients are also not keeping around authorization URLs, so they can't just go [deactivate](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/#rfc.section.6.5.2) them.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution would be to re-add the \"authorizations\" field to the account object, which got lost in the refactor in #208 or so.  Together with deactivation, enabling clients to enumerate authorization URLs would solve this problem.\r\n\r\nYou could also envision a more direct solution, offering an endpoint that just deletes all pending authorizations for a client or client+identifier."

    "body": "Copied from: letsencrypt/acme-spec#242\r\n\r\nAs you (LE) seem to be strongly concerned over adding the option to adding the possibility to do the challange over alternate ports (some of which I are valid, but all of which can be handled in a secure way nonetheless - such as using a DNS record and other solutions to address have been already stated in here), I propose to add at least an alternate hostname for the http challange.\r\n\r\nThis would enable us to add a specific virtual host, answering to *.acme.invalid and redirect that to a specific wwhost, which can be used by the certbot to place the necessary files to complete the challange.\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible to add global aliases in nginx for example, so this way it would be possible to issue certificates without having to either have certbot modify the nginx config (yes, it's possible to do that in a zero-downtime way, but it makes my sysadmin inner self scream - my software reconfiguring my other software...), or have to add the location redirect to all vhosts, which is not as easy as it sounds when they get generated by different software components.\r\n\r\nIf we'd say that the challange has to respond for the Host header of example.com.acme.invalid OR example.com (current) that would make all our lives easier, while maintaining a) backward compatibility b) ease of use for the average joe.\r\n\r\nNot as easy as with a custom port, but still a lot more easy to automate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\n\r\n> kelunik commented 4 hours ago\r\n> @axos88 You can redirect /.well-known/acme-challenge/* to another (virtual) host at any time. The validation authority will follow any redirects. You could also use includes to define a common web root just for /.well-known/acme-challenge, that's what I usually do.\r\n\r\n> axos88 commented 2 hours ago • edited\r\n> As stated, this is not that easy to do when the server configuration is generated by different software components (chef cookbooks) that one does not have control over. Unfortunately there are no global aliases / redirects in nginx, only per server.\r\n> \r\n> This would also mean that in order to use letsencrypt, one has to MODIFY the current configuration, \r\n\r\n> rather than ADD a new virtualhost declaration. Modifying something generated by some other actor is always a bad idea (this is one of the reasons conf.d directories exist btw).\r\n> \r\n> axos88 commented 2 hours ago\r\n> For example: I have an automated installer for an web application, running over let's say ruby on rails. The application is obviously unaware, and should NEVER be aware how it's exposed to the internet. Thus it is unaware of how its SSL certificate is obtained and installed (normally it wouldn't even run on https, but would rely on a forward proxy to terminate the ssl connection, and forward it using http, but that's another matter).\r\n> \r\n> Now my automated installer installs this software, and also installs and configures nginx for forward proxying. It will configure the nginx vhost, and other things that are needed. I don't know that LE exists, my installer just asks for the path to a certificate and a key.\r\n> \r\n> Now I sell my software to a third party, who uses my installer (chef cookbook) to install my software on THEIR infrastructure. THEY are smarter then me, and know that LE exists, and want to use it to create the certs.\r\n> \r\n> Current options:\r\n> \r\n> They start hacking around the nginx configuration generated by my installer and add the alias - not good, the next update will overwrite their changes, and they won't be able to renew\r\n> They stop nginx every time they need to upgrade the certs for the duration of the verification - unacceptable\r\n> They use dns challenge if they can - usually it cannot be automated, or is a great effort to add dns records automatically.\r\n> They use the tls challenge (although it doesn't supprot nginx yet), and they modify its configuration during every verification, reloading its configuration, etc. Can easily create problems if someone is maintaining the server at the same time, etc.\r\n> OR: They also create a virtualhost accepting connections for *.acme.invalid once during installation, redirect it to a webroot, and have the verification client drop files into that webroot. Configure it once, and it works. Unnecessary to modify configuration files generated by other installers, unnecessary to keep reloading the nginx configuration all the time, less possibility for failure.\r\n> \r\n> axos88 commented an hour ago\r\n> And let's face it, validation requests to a vhost have NOTHING to do with the software who serves the content on that server. They are intended for a totally different actor (certbot), thus they should be routed to a different vhost, not be mingled into all the other ones as locations and aliases, and such.\r\n> \r\n> kelunik commented an hour ago\r\n> unnecessary to keep reloading the nginx configuration all the time\r\n> You have to do that anyway for Nginx to use the new certificate instead of the old one.\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, this is something that should be in the official repository instead and on the ACME mailing list.\r\n> \r\n> axos88 commented 3 minutes ago\r\n> unnecessary to keep reloading the nginx configuration all the time\r\n> You have to do that anyway for Nginx to use the new certificate instead of the old one.\r\n> True true, but at least you are not modifying configuration."

    "body": "The previous definition of requirements created an awkward extra level of indirection, with status defined both on requirements and authorizations. It also created another object type, increasing the complexity of the protocol.\n\nIt was added mainly to provide a concept of an \"out-of-band\" requirement that could be satisfied, for instance, by adding funds to an account. However, this concept fits very well within the existing authorization framework, if we tweak the definition of authorizations so that authorizations are not always for domain names. Instead, we specify a type field on the authorization object, which can be \"DNSName\" or any other server-defined value. We can use the existing Out-of-Band challenge type to convey a link for users to visit to, for instance, provide payment.\n\nFor \"DNSName\" authorizations, the same constraints still hold - there is a defined DNS name, and the challenges apply to that specific name.\n\nEditorially, I wound up moving the section about verifying correct Punycode encoding to new-application, since that is where the check needs to happen.\n"

    "body": "In [Section 6.1.2 \"Registration Objects\"](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/blob/83e2f7985f5921a4ac30b7446dbb9c1d347d69ec/draft-ietf-acme-acme.md#registration-objects) the \"applications\" field of the registration resource is described in great detail. This is confusing for two reasons:\n1. both the text and the example registration object are still using the \"authorization\" term that applications replace.\n2. the text is written as if the applications should be directly embedded in the registration object returned.\n\nThis PR addresses both issues by describing the \"applications\" field as an array of application URIs that the client can fetch. The example \"registration\" object is updated accordingly.\n\nThe note indicating a server SHOULD include pending applications and SHOULD NOT include invalid applications remains as-is. The note indicating a server MAY return an incomplete list is removed - it is more complicated and with only URIs being returned, likely an unneeded optimization.\n\nFinally, in [Section 6.3 \"Registration\"](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/blob/83e2f7985f5921a4ac30b7446dbb9c1d347d69ec/draft-ietf-acme-acme.md#registration) there are three fields that must be ignored by the server in a registration body: key, authorizations and certificates. This should be \"key\" and \"applications\" and is updated accordingly.\n"

The open\nissue corresponding to making this decision is removed now that there is one supported option.\n\nIn an effort to close out open questions around applications this commit also removes the open issue around multiple certificates per application. If there is a demand for automating repeat issuance there should be a new thread started with a concrete proposal.\n\n0: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/acme/0lVmGl8e-rmSH0x7ycDW5dj6GAY\n"

It's not clear to me what this MUST is trying to prevent, especially in light of an allowance of multiple URIs if functionality is equivalent.\n\nSimilarly, while the text prior to this PR says \"new-X\" I believe the intentions of the statements that follow would include some of the resources that have been added since, e.g. \"key-change\".\n\nThis PR updates the \"new-X\" language to include the additional singular resources and removes the MUST.\n\nIf I've missed the mark in this clarification perhaps someone who was involved with the spec at the time of this paragraph's writing can help guide us to something both clear & accurate to the original spirit. \n"

    "body": "It seem like the only way to retrieve an existing registration object for a given key is to provoke an error by attempting to register again with the same key and read the Location from it.\n\n> If the server already has a registration object with the provided account key, then it MUST return a 409 (Conflict) response and provide the URI of that registration in a Location header field. This allows a client that has an account key but not the corresponding registration URI to recover the registration URI.\n\nAs a client library implementor, I would expect to `40x` and `50x` to not be recoverable. I think its strange that the only way to recover the registration object is by triggering an error.\n\nWould it make sense to add an extra endpoint to simply retrieve the registration object?\n\nAlternatively, I don't see any reason for the endpoint not to return `200` when already registered (instead of `201` when it create the registration) as opposed to a `409`.\n\nAlso, the returned error type in boulder is [Malformed](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/821d572366b9b30b8065102ab767dad8ac00e31c/probs/probs.go#L97), which does not make much sense to me since the request was not malformed. If its an expected behaviour to provoke an error to recover data from the response, the error type should be specify into the spec and unique so its can be recovered from easily.\n\nImplementation in boulder [here](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/7e946eaacc30e5625d49a8a5bba597854a52f7bd/wfe/wfe.go#L558) and initial discussion in the ruby [acme-client](https://github.com/unixcharles/acme-client/issues/81).\n"

That raises a risk that if you got an \"old/new\" signature, you could copy/paste the \"new/new\" signature and get a valid `key-change` request.\n\nAs long as we have parallel signatures (cf. #148), we need to have both the old and new keys in the payloads.\n"

    "body": "Looking at the current `key-change` mechanism in a little more detail, I have a few concerns with the parallel-signature approach that's there now:\n- It's not clear which signature is by the old key and which is by the new key, and the new key doesn't sign over the old key. \n- Both signatures have to include the `\"nonce\"` parameter, so this request burns two nonces unnecessarily\n- The server's JWS checking code now has to switch between validating one signature and two\n- Lots of JWS implementations don't support multiple signatures\n- If not for this, we could require the flattened JSON serialization\n- You need a lot of duplication to deal with the copy/paste attacks (cf. #149).\n\n(On the other hand, I like that both signatures cover the `\"url\"` parameter; reduces replayability.)\n\nI would propose that we change the signatures from parallel back to serial, as illustrated below.  It would cost a little bit of payload bloat (due to another layer of base64url encoding), but I think the benefits in terms of conceptual simplicity would be worth it.\n\n```\nOLD:\n\n{\n  \"payload\": base64url({\n    \"key\": /* New key in JWK form */\n  }),\n  \"signatures\": [{\n    \"protected\": base64url({\n      \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n      \"jwk\": /* old key */,\n      \"nonce\": \"pq00v-D1KB0sReG4jFfqVg\",\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/acme/key-change\"\n    }),\n    \"signature\": \"XFvVbo9diBlIBvhE...UI62sNT6MZsCJpQo\"\n  }, {\n    \"protected\": base64url({\n      \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n      \"jwk\": /* new key */,\n      \"nonce\": \"vYjyueEYhMjpVQHe_unw4g\",\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/acme/key-change\"\n    }),\n    \"signature\": \"q20gG1f1r9cD6tBM...a48h0CkP11tl5Doo\"\n  }]\n}\n\n\nNEW:\n\n{\n  \"protected\": base64url({\n    \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n    \"jwk\": /* old key in JWK form */,\n    \"nonce\": \"pq00v-D1KB0sReG4jFfqVg\",\n    \"url\": \"https://example.com/acme/key-change\"\n  }),\n  \"payload\": base64({\n    \"protected\": base64url({\n      \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n      \"jwk\": /* new key in JWK form */,\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/acme/key-change\"\n    }),\n    \"payload\": base64url({\n      \"oldKey\": /* old key in JWK form */\n    }),\n    \"signature\": \"q20gG1f1r9cD6tBM...a48h0CkP11tl5Doo\"\n  }),\n  \"signature\": \"XFvVbo9diBlIBvhE...UI62sNT6MZsCJpQo\"\n}\n```\n"

    "body": "Server side request forgery (SSRF) is possible through ACME when using http-01 because an attacker can use HTTP 3xx redirects to make the ACME verifier server perform an HTTP GET of any URL. Additionally, Boulder helpfully includes (part) of the HTTP body in the detail field of Unauthorized errors.\n\nIn theory, an HTTP GET of any URL is idempotent and won't actually affect anything. But, if the ACME server returns any part of the HTTP body in error messages (like Boulder does), an attacker could potentially read sensitive data from internal servers.\n\nTypical targets for SSRF would be metadata services (like 169.254.169.254 in AWS or OpenStack), any not publicly exposed HTTP interface of the server's stack (like the HTTP API of the RabbitMQ management plugin), or any other internal HTTP server on the server's private network.\n\nPerhaps the IETF ACME protocol spec should acknowledge SSRF in its Security Considerations? One recommendation could be to not allow connections to internal network addresses. However, if someone wanted to use ACME for a private intranet CA, correct firewalling like that is much harder. The spec could also discourage including the HTTP body in an Unauthorized error's detail field. Or at least don't include the HTTP body if a redirect was followed.\n\nAlso, this is mostly mitigated by the actual implementation of Let's Encrypt and Boulder. Notably, only 128 characters (maxResponseSize) of the HTTP body are [returned by Boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/51425cab815936d9f9ff2a2a6aef1aff75b5a042/va/va.go#L274). And it doesn't seem possible to get Let's Encrypt to access HTTP servers on any port other than 80 or 443, even with a port number specified in the redirect URL, which limits what an attacker could access.\n\n(I reported this privately to security@letsencrypt.org before creating this GitHub issue. This is not an issue for Let's Encrypt.)\n"

It was already almost entirely unspecified, due to it being a process that primarily takes place outside of ACME.  Removing account recovery from ACME simplifies both the protocol and the security considerations.\n\nAs an alternative, this PR adds an `account-mgmt` field to the `meta` dictionary in the directory, which the CA can use to expose account management functions such as recovery.  But you can also imagine using this for more sophisticated account management functions, like associating an ACME account with some other account in a different system.\n"

    "body": "one of the problems of dns-01 is that it's hard to automate without giving up the complete control over the DNS to the LE server, meaning that important data like the password (or in case of \"smarter\" DNS solutions, an API key, which still has a lot of access) and especially in cases with strict security you might not want to automate everything because it's more transparent when you do the stuff yourself.\nwell let's cut the preamble and get to the point.\nomne of the key annoyances (aside from using random challenges (see #88) is that you have to add a record for each and every domain, which means that e.g. for a 100 name SAN cert which are all under 1 domain you have to add and/or change a whole 100 records (and sign the whole stuff when using DNSSec)\naside from being annoying this the inefficient, seriously.\nmy idea would be (based on the currect TXT record structure:\n\n```\n_acme-challenge.x.y.example.com 120 IN TXT \"9C0DqKC_4MkowIFByHhFaP8u0Zv4z7Wz2IHM91lTKec\"\n```\n\nthat the following will be used instead:\n\n```\n_acme-challenge.example.com 120 IN TXT \"delegate 9C0DqKC_4MkowIFByHhFaP8u0Zv4z7Wz2IHM91lTKec\"\n```\n\ncombining this with #88 results in \n\n```\n_acme-challenge.example.com 120 IN TXT \"delegate key h53FF1QB43DZTQleR4VQQCxl7UQu1AgNAErm791z3DO3lrNMqfbLWsLw80RLHximiAFyY+i8nySyo7LJsbjpaw\"\n```\n\nwith the order of the flags not mattering (`key delegate` and `delegate key` being treated as the same)\nand when checking for example for x.y.example.com\nit goes the follwing way:\ncheck the challenge records for x.y.example.com, if a valid one is found, stop and mark as complete, if not continue\ncheck the challenge records for y.example.com for delegation flagged ones, if valid, mark as complete, if not continue.\ncheck exmaple.com for valid delegation challenges, if valid, mark as complete, if not STOP, because com is on PSL.\n"

    "body": "it's a bit frustrating when you cannot properly automate the challenges for whatever reason, and when having to do a large SAN cert it gets even more annoying (e.g. having 14 SANs and then having to copypaste 14 file names AND contents from SSH to the text editor and saving each file just so you can get your cert.\nmy Idea would be to make an authorised_keys style file (e.g. `.well-known/acme-challenge/le-keys.txt`) which contains the authorised lets encrypt accounts for http-01 and \n\nadding the key hashes to TXT records like \n`_acme-challenge.example.com 120 IN TXT \"key h53FF1QB43DZTQleR4VQQCxl7UQu1AgNAErm791z3DO3lrNMqfbLWsLw80RLHximiAFyY+i8nySyo7LJsbjpaw\"`\nmaking a SHA512 in base64 takes up 86 characters, so you could make the record start with\n`key` and a space before the hash, so it would be able to recognize old and new hashes alike.\n\n(you could also, for lower data consumption add the key hashes to the key-file instead of the whole keys).\n\nI would say that Sha512 should be used for generating the keys. in General SHA2 is a good hash family and longer sizes makes finding collisions harder.\n\nThe main point of this challenge is that you can just copypaste the same file to all the webroots, which also makes it easier on the LE side since it doesnt have to generate challenges since all API requests have to be signed with the account key anyway. verify those with the key file/records and finish.\n\nthis issue can be combined with #89 for DNS-01 as described there.\n"

For example, if a requested validity date is longer than the policy, should it error back or just ignore that attribute and issue a cert good for as long as it wants?  That seems okay.  But what about an unsupported request  for issuance in the future?  Ignoring that seems wrong, and risky.\n"

(I consider myself a fairly knowledgable guy and it took me a few hours of experimentation to arrive at a working solution)\n\nAlso note that there are a number of ports available for IANA registration:\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml\n\nIt looks like port 4 is ripe for an RFC. And 6,8,10,12,14,16,26,28,30,32,34,36,40,60.\n\nOne of the available ports could be used in place of 443 for validation.\n\nOr, to make it super simple, the client could request any port below 1024 (or even above it!) to be used for validation / registration.\n"
