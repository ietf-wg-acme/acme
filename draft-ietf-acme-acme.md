--- abstract

Certificates in the Web's X.509 PKI (PKIX) are used for a number of purposes,
the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names.  Thus,
certificate authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant
for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.
Today, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.
This document describes a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an
applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate
issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate
management functions, such as certificate revocation.

# Introduction

Certificates in the Web PKI {{!RFC5280}} are most commonly used to authenticate
domain names.  Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to
verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain
name(s) in the certificate.

Existing Web PKI certificate authorities tend to run on a set of ad hoc
protocols for certificate issuance and identity verification.  A typical user
experience is something like:

* Generate a PKCS#10 {{!RFC2986}} Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
* Cut-and-paste the CSR into a CA web page.
* Prove ownership of the domain by one of the following methods:
   * Put a CA-provided challenge at a specific place on the web server.
   * Put a CA-provided challenge at a DNS location corresponding to the target
     domain.
   * Receive CA challenge at a (hopefully) administrator-controlled e-mail
     address corresponding to the domain and then respond to it on the CA's web
     page.
* Download the issued certificate and install it on their Web Server.

With the exception of the CSR itself and the certificates that are issued, these
are all completely ad hoc procedures and are accomplished by getting the human
user to follow interactive natural-language instructions from the CA rather than
by machine-implemented published protocols.  In many cases, the instructions are
difficult to follow and cause significant confusion.  Informal usability tests
by the authors indicate that webmasters often need 1-3 hours to obtain and
install a certificate for a domain.  Even in the best case, the lack of
published, standardized mechanisms presents an obstacle to the wide deployment
of HTTPS and other PKIX-dependent systems because it inhibits mechanization of
tasks related to certificate issuance, deployment, and revocation.

This document describes an extensible framework for automating the issuance and
domain validation procedure, thereby allowing servers and infrastructural
software to obtain certificates without user interaction.  Use of this protocol
should radically simplify the deployment of HTTPS and the practicality of PKIX
authentication for other protocols based on TLS {{!RFC5246}}.

# Deployment Model and Operator Experience

The major guiding use case for ACME is obtaining certificates for Web sites
(HTTPS {{!RFC2818}}).  In that case, the server is intended to speak for one or
more domains, and the process of certificate issuance is intended to verify that
the server actually speaks for the domain(s).

Different types of certificates reflect different kinds of CA verification of
information about the certificate subject.  "Domain Validation" (DV)
certificates are by far the most common type.  For DV validation, the CA merely
verifies that the requester has effective control of the web server and/or DNS
server for the domain, but does not explicitly attempt to verify their
real-world identity.  (This is as opposed to "Organization Validation" (OV) and
"Extended Validation" (EV) certificates, where the process is intended to also
verify the real-world identity of the requester.)

DV certificate validation commonly checks claims about properties related to
control of a domain name -- properties that can be observed by the issuing
authority in an interactive process that can be conducted purely online.  That
means that under typical circumstances, all steps in the request, verification,
and issuance process can be represented and performed by Internet protocols with
no out-of-band human intervention.

When deploying a current HTTPS server, an operator generally gets a prompt to
generate a self-signed certificate.  When an operator deploys an ACME-compatible
web server, the experience would be something like this:

* The ACME client prompts the operator for the intended domain name(s) that the
  web server is to stand for.
* The ACME client presents the operator with a list of CAs from which it could
  get a certificate.  (This list will change over time based on the capabilities
  of CAs and updates to ACME configuration.) The ACME client might prompt the
  operator for payment information at this point.
* The operator selects a CA.
* In the background, the ACME client contacts the CA and requests that a
  certificate be issued for the intended domain name(s).
* Once the CA is satisfied, the certificate is issued and the ACME client
  automatically downloads and installs it, potentially notifying the operator
  via e-mail, SMS, etc.
* The ACME client periodically contacts the CA to get updated certificates,
  stapled OCSP responses, or whatever else would be required to keep the server
  functional and its credentials up-to-date.

The overall idea is that it's nearly as easy to deploy with a CA-issued
certificate as a self-signed certificate, and that once the operator has done
so, the process is self-sustaining with minimal manual intervention.  Close
integration of ACME with HTTPS servers, for example, can allow the immediate and
automated deployment of certificates as they are issued, optionally sparing the
human administrator from additional configuration work.


# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 {{!RFC2119}}.

The two main roles in ACME are “client” and “server”.  The ACME client uses the
protocol to request certificate management actions, such as issuance or
revocation.  An ACME client therefore typically runs on a web server, mail
server, or some other server system which requires valid TLS certificates.  The
ACME server runs at a certificate authority, and responds to client requests,
performing the requested actions if the client is authorized.

An ACME client is represented by an "account key pair".  The client uses the
private key of this key pair to sign all messages sent to the server.  The
server uses the public key to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages
from the client.

# Protocol Overview

ACME allows a client to request certificate management actions using a set of
JSON messages carried over HTTPS.   In some ways, ACME functions much like a
traditional CA, in which a user creates an account, adds identifiers to that
account (proving control of the domains), and requests certificate issuance for
those domains while logged in to the account.

In ACME, the account is represented by an account key pair.  The "add a domain"
function is accomplished by authorizing the key pair for a given domain.
Certificate issuance and revocation are authorized by a signature with the key
pair.

The first phase of ACME is for the client to register with the ACME server.  The
client generates an asymmetric key pair and associates this key pair with a set
of contact information by signing the contact information.  The server
acknowledges the registration by replying with a registration object echoing the
client's input.  The server can also provide terms of service at this stage,
which the client can present to a human user.

~~~~~~~~~~
      Client                                                  Server

      Contact Information
      Signature                     ------->

                                    <-------            Registration
                                                    Terms of Service
~~~~~~~~~~


Once the client is registered, there are three major steps it needs to take to
get a certificate:

1. Apply for a certificate to be issued
2. Fulfill the server's requirements for issuance
3. Finalize the application and request issuance

The client's application for a certificate describes the desired certificate
using a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) plus a few additional fields
that capture semantics that are not supported in the CSR format.  If the server
is willing to consider issuing such a certificate, it responds with a list of
requirements that the client must satisfy before the certificate will be issued.

For example, in most cases, the server will require the client to demonstrate
that it controls the identifiers in the requested certificate.  Because there
are many different ways to validate possession of different types of
identifiers, the server will choose from an extensible set of challenges that
are appropriate for the identifier being claimed.  The client responds with a
set of responses that tell the server which challenges the client has completed.
The server then validates the challenges to check that the client has
accomplished the challenge.

Once the validation process is complete and the server is satisfied that the
client has met its requirements, the server can either proactively issue the
requested certificate or wait for the client to request that the application be
"finalized", at which point the certificate will be issued and provided to the
client.

~~~~~~~~~~
      Application
      Signature                     ------->
                                    <-------            Requirements
                                                  (e.g., Challenges)

      Responses
      Signature                     ------->

                          <~~~~~~~~Validation~~~~~~~~>

      Finalize application
      Signature                     ------->
                                    <-------             Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~

To revoke a certificate, the client simply sends a revocation request indicating
the certificate to be revoked, signed with an authorized key pair. The server
indicates whether the request has succeeded.

~~~~~~~~~~
      Client                                                 Server

      Revocation request
      Signature                    -------->

                                   <--------                 Result
~~~~~~~~~~

Note that while ACME is defined with enough flexibility to handle different
types of identifiers in principle, the primary use case addressed by this
document is the case where domain names are used as identifiers.  For example,
all of the identifier validation challenges described in
{{identifier-validation-challenges}} below address validation of domain names.
The use of ACME for other protocols will require further specification, in order
to describe how these identifiers are encoded in the protocol, and what types of
validation challenges the server might require.

# Message Transport

Communications between an ACME client and an ACME server are done over HTTPS,
using JWS to provide some additional security properties for messages sent from
the client to the server.  HTTPS provides server authentication and
confidentiality.  With some ACME-specific extensions, JWS provides
authentication of the client's request payloads, anti-replay protection, and
integrity for the HTTPS request URI.

## HTTPS Requests

Each ACME function is accomplished by the client sending a sequence of HTTPS
requests to the server, carrying JSON messages {{!RFC2818}}{{!RFC7159}}.  Use of
HTTPS is REQUIRED.  Clients SHOULD support HTTP public key pinning {{?RFC7469}},
and servers SHOULD emit pinning headers.  Each subsection of
{{certificate-management}} below describes the message formats used by the
function, and the order in which messages are sent.

In all HTTPS transactions used by ACME, the ACME client is the HTTPS client and
the ACME server is the HTTPS server.

ACME servers that are intended to be generally accessible need to use
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in order to be accessible from
browser-based clients {{?W3C.CR-cors-20130129}}.  Such servers SHOULD set the
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header field to the value "*".

Binary fields in the JSON objects used by ACME are encoded using base64url
encoding described in {{!RFC4648}} Section 5, according to the profile specified
in JSON Web Signature {{!RFC7515}} Section 2. This encoding uses a URL safe
character set. Trailing '=' characters MUST be stripped.

## Request Authentication

All ACME requests with a non-empty body MUST encapsulate the body in a JWS
object, signed using the account key pair.  The server MUST verify the JWS
before processing the request.  (For readability, however, the examples below
omit this encapsulation.)  Encapsulating request bodies in JWS provides a simple
authentication of requests by way of key continuity.

JWS objects sent in ACME requests MUST meet the following additional criteria:

* The JWS MUST be encoded using UTF-8
* The JWS MUST NOT have the value "none" in its "alg" field
* The JWS Protected Header MUST include the following fields:
  * "alg"
  * "jwk"
  * "nonce" (defined below)
  * "url" (defined below)

Note that this implies that GET requests are not authenticated.  Servers MUST
NOT respond to GET requests for resources that might be considered sensitive.

In the examples below, JWS objects are shown in the JSON or flattened JSON
serialization, with the protected header and payload expressed as
base64url(content) instead of the actual base64-encoded value, so that the content
is readable.  Some fields are omitted for brevity, marked with "...".

## Request URI Integrity

It is common in deployment the entity terminating TLS for HTTPS to be different
from the entity operating the logical HTTPS server, with a "request routing"
layer in the middle.  For example, an ACME CA might have a content delivery
network terminate TLS connections from clients so that it can inspect client
requests for denial-of-service protection.

These intermediaries can also change values in the request that are not signed
in the HTTPS request, e.g., the request URI and headers.  ACME uses JWS to
provide a limited integrity mechanism, which protects against an intermediary
changing the request URI to another ACME URI of a different type.  (It does not
protect against changing between URIs of the same type, e.g., from one
authorization URI to another).

As noted above, all ACME request object carry a "url" parameter in their
protected header.  This header parameter encodes the URL to which the client is
directing the request.  On receiving such an object in an HTTP request, the server
MUST compare the "url" parameter to the request URI.  If the two do not match,
then the server MUST reject the request as unauthorized.

Except for the directory resource, all ACME resources are addressed with URLs
provided to the client by the server.  In such cases, the client MUST set the
"url" field to the exact string provided by the server (rather than performing
any re-encoding on the URL).

### "url" (URL) JWS header parameter

The "url" header parameter specifies the URL to which this JWS object is
directed {{!RFC3986}}.  The "url" parameter MUST be carried in the protected
header of the JWS.  The value of the "nonce" header MUST be a JSON string
representing the URL.

## Replay protection

In order to protect ACME resources from any possible replay attacks, ACME
requests have a mandatory anti-replay mechanism.  This mechanism is based on the
server maintaining a list of nonces that it has issued to clients, and requiring
any signed request from the client to carry such a nonce.

An ACME server MUST include a Replay-Nonce header field in each successful
response it provides to a client, with contents as specified below.  In
particular, the ACME server MUST provide a Replay-Nonce header field in response
to a HEAD request for any valid resource.  (This allows clients to easily obtain
a fresh nonce.)  It MAY also provide nonces in error responses.

Every JWS sent by an ACME client MUST include, in its protected header, the
"nonce" header parameter, with contents as defined below.  As part of JWS
verification, the ACME server MUST verify that the value of the "nonce" header
is a value that the server previously provided in a Replay-Nonce header field.
Once a nonce value has appeared in an ACME request, the server MUST consider it
invalid, in the same way as a value it had never issued.

When a server rejects a request because its nonce value was unacceptable (or not
present), it SHOULD provide HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request), and indicate the
ACME error code "urn:ietf:params:acme:error:badNonce".

The precise method used to generate and track nonces is up to the server.  For
example, the server could generate a random 128-bit value for each response,
keep a list of issued nonces, and strike nonces from this list as they are used.

### Replay-Nonce

The "Replay-Nonce" header field includes a server-generated value that the
server can use to detect unauthorized replay in future client requests.  The
server should generate the value provided in Replay-Nonce in such a way that
they are unique to each message, with high probability.

The value of the Replay-Nonce field MUST be an octet string encoded according to
the base64url encoding described in Section 2 of {{!RFC7515}}.  Clients MUST
ignore invalid Replay-Nonce values.

~~~~~
  base64url = [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "_"

  Replay-Nonce = *base64url
~~~~~

The Replay-Nonce header field SHOULD NOT be included in HTTP request messages.

### "nonce" (Nonce) JWS header parameter

The "nonce" header parameter provides a unique value that enables the verifier
of a JWS to recognize when replay has occurred. The "nonce" header parameter
MUST be carried in the protected header of the JWS.

The value of the "nonce" header parameter MUST be an octet string, encoded
according to the base64url encoding described in Section 2 of {{!RFC7515}}.  If
the value of a "nonce" header parameter is not valid according to this encoding,
then the verifier MUST reject the JWS as malformed.

## Rate limits

Creation of resources can be rate limited to ensure fair usage and prevent
abuse.  Once the rate limit is exceeded, the server MUST respond with an error
with the code "rateLimited".  Additionally, the server SHOULD send a
"Retry-After" header indicating when the current request may succeed again.  If
multiple rate limits are in place, that is the time where all rate limits allow
access again for the current request with exactly the same parameters.

In addition to the human readable "detail" field of the error response, the
server MAY send one or multiple tokens in the "Link" header pointing to
documentation about the specific hit rate limits using the "rate-limit"
relation.

## Errors

Errors can be reported in ACME both at the HTTP layer and within ACME payloads.
ACME servers can return responses with an HTTP error response code (4XX or 5XX).
For example:  If the client submits a request using a method not allowed in this
document, then the server MAY return status code 405 (Method Not Allowed).

When the server responds with an error status, it SHOULD provide additional
information using problem document {{!RFC7807}}.
To facilitate automatic response
to errors, this document defines the following standard tokens for use in the
"type" field (within the "urn:ietf:params:acme:error:" namespace):

| Code                  | Description                                        |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| badCSR                | The CSR is unacceptable (e.g., due to a short key) |
| badNonce              | The client sent an unacceptable anti-replay nonce  |
| connection            | The server could not connect to validation target  |
| dnssec                | DNSSEC validation failed                           |
| caa                   | CAA records forbid the CA from issuing             |
| malformed             | The request message was malformed                  |
| serverInternal        | The server experienced an internal error           |
| tls                   | The server received a TLS error during validation  |
| unauthorized          | The client lacks sufficient authorization          |
| unknownHost           | The server could not resolve a domain name         |
| rateLimited           | The request exceeds a rate limit                   |
| invalidContact        | The contact URI for a registration was invalid     |
| rejectedIdentifier    | The server will not issue for the identifier       |
| unsupportedIdentifier | Identifier is not supported, but may be in future  |

This list is not exhaustive. The server MAY return errors whose "type" field is
set to a URI other than those defined above.  Servers MUST NOT use the ACME URN
namespace for errors other than the standard types.  Clients SHOULD display the
"detail" field of such errors.

Authorization and challenge objects can also contain error information to
indicate why the server was unable to validate authorization.


# Certificate Management

In this section, we describe the certificate management functions that ACME
enables:

  * Account Key Registration
  * Application for a Certificate
  * Account Key Authorization
  * Certificate Issuance
  * Certificate Revocation

## Resources

ACME is structured as a REST application with a few types of resources:

* Registration resources, representing information about an account
* Application resources, represnting an account's requests to issue certificates
* Authorization resources, representing an account's authorization to act for an
  identifier
* Challenge resources, representing a challenge to prove control of an
  identifier
* Certificate resources, representing issued certificates
* A "directory" resource
* A "new-registration" resource
* A "new-application" resource
* A "revoke-certificate" resource
* A "key-change" resource

For the "new-X" resources above, the server MUST have exactly one resource for
each function.  This resource may be addressed by multiple URIs, but all must
provide equivalent functionality.

ACME uses different URIs for different management functions. Each function is
listed in a directory along with its corresponding URI, so clients only need to
be configured with the directory URI.  These URIs are connected by a few
different link relations {{!RFC5988}}.

The "up" link relation is used with challenge resources to indicate the
authorization resource to which a challenge belongs.  It is also used from
certificate resources to indicate a resource from which the client may fetch a
chain of CA certificates that could be used to validate the certificate in the
original resource.

The "directory" link relation is present on all resources other than the
directory and indicates the directory URL.

The following diagram illustrates the relations between resources on an ACME
server.  For the most part, these relations are expressed by URLs provided as
strings in the resources' JSON representations.  Lines with labels in quotes
indicate HTTP link relations

~~~~~~~~~~
                               directory

       ----------------------------------------------------
       |                  |                               |
       |                  |                               |
       V                  V                               V
    new-reg            new-app                       revoke-cert
       |                  |                               ^
       |                  |                               | "revoke"
       V                  V                               |
      reg -------------> app -------------> cert ---------+
                         | ^                  |
                         | | "up"             | "up"
                         V |                  V
                        authz             cert-chain
                         | ^
                         | | "up"
                         V |
                       challenge
~~~~~~~~~~

The following table illustrates a typical sequence of requests required to
establish a new account with the server, prove control of an identifier, issue a
certificate, and fetch an updated certificate some time after issuance.  The
"->" is a mnemonic for a Location header pointing to a created resource.

| Action             | Request        | Response   |
|:-------------------|:---------------|:-----------|
| Register           | POST new-reg   | 201 -> reg |
| Apply for a cert   | POST new-app   | 201 -> app |
| Fetch challenges   | GET  authz     | 200        |
| Answer challenges  | POST challenge | 200        |
| Poll for status    | GET  authz     | 200        |
| Request issuance   | POST app       | 200        |
| Check for new cert | GET  cert      | 200        |

The remainder of this section provides the details of how these resources are
structured and how the ACME protocol makes use of them.

### Directory

In order to help clients configure themselves with the right URIs for each ACME
operation, ACME servers provide a directory object. This should be the only URL
needed to configure clients. It is a JSON dictionary, whose keys are drawn from
the following table and whose values are the corresponding URLs.

| Key         | URL in value         |
|:------------|:---------------------|
| new-reg     | New registration     |
| new-app     | New application      |
| revoke-cert | Revoke certificate   |
| key-change  | Key change           |

There is no constraint on the actual URI of the directory except that it
should be different from the other ACME server resources' URIs, and that it
should not clash with other services. For instance:

 * a host which function as both an ACME and Web server may want to keep
   the root path "/" for an HTML "front page", and and place the ACME
   directory under path "/acme".

 * a host which only functions as an ACME server could place the directory
   under path "/".

The dictionary MAY additionally contain a key "meta". If present, it MUST be a
JSON dictionary; each item in the dictionary is an item of metadata relating to
the service provided by the ACME server.

The following metadata items are defined, all of which are OPTIONAL:

"terms-of-service" (optional, string):
: A URI identifying the current terms of service.

"website" (optional, string)):
: An HTTP or HTTPS URL locating a website providing more
information about the ACME server.

"caa-identities" (optional, array of string):
: Each string MUST be a lowercase hostname which the ACME server recognises as
referring to itself for the purposes of CAA record validation as defined in
{{!RFC6844}}.  This allows clients to determine the correct issuer domain name to
use when configuring CAA record.

Clients access the directory by sending a GET request to the directory URI.

### Registration Objects

An ACME registration resource represents a set of metadata associated to an
account key pair.  Registration resources have the following structure:

key (required, dictionary):
: The public key of the account key pair, encoded as a JSON Web Key object
{{!RFC7517}}.

status (required, string):
: "good" or "deactivated"

contact (optional, array of string):
: An array of URIs that the server can use to contact the client for issues
related to this authorization. For example, the server may wish to notify the
client about server-initiated revocation.

agreement (optional, string):
: A URI referring to a subscriber agreement or terms of service provided by the
server (see below).  Including this field indicates the client's agreement with
the referenced terms.

applications (required, string):
: A URI from which a list of authorizations submitted by this account can be
fetched via a GET request.  The result of the GET request MUST be a JSON object
whose "applications" field is an array of strings, where each string is the URI
of an authorization belonging to this registration.  The server SHOULD include
pending applications, and SHOULD NOT include applications that are invalid. The
server MAY return an incomplete list, along with a Link header with link
relation "next" indicating a URL to retrieve further entries.

certificates (required, string):
: A URI from which a list of certificates issued for this account can be fetched
via a GET request.  The result of the GET request MUST be a JSON object whose
"certificates" field is an array of strings, where each string is the URI of a
certificate.  The server SHOULD NOT include expired or revoked certificates.
The server MAY return an incomplete list, along with a Link header with link
relation "next" indicating a URL to retrieve further entries.

  "contact": [
    "mailto:cert-admin@example.com",

  "authorizations": "https://example.com/acme/reg/1/authz",
  "certificates": "https://example.com/acme/reg/1/cert"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

### Application Objects

An ACME registration resource represents a client's request for a certificate,
and is used to track the progress of that application through to issuance.
Thus, the object contains information about the requested certificate, the
server's requirements, and any certificates that have resulted from this
application.

status (required, string):
: The status of this authorization.  Possible values are: "unknown", "pending",
"processing", "valid", and "invalid".

expires (optional, string):
: The timestamp after which the server will consider this application invalid,
encoded in the format specified in RFC 3339 {{!RFC3339}}.  This field is REQUIRED
for objects with "pending" or "valid" in the status field.

csr (required, string):
: A CSR encoding the parameters for the certificate being requested {{!RFC2986}}.
The CSR is sent in the Base64url-encoded version of the DER format.  (Note: This
field uses the same modified Base64 encoding rules used elsewhere in this
document, so it is different from PEM.)

notBefore (optional, string):
: The requested value of the notBefore field in the certificate, in the date
format defined in {{!RFC3339}}

notAfter (optional, string):
: The requested value of the notAfter field in the certificate, in the date
format defined in {{!RFC3339}}

requirements (required, array):
: The requirements that the client needs to fulfill before the requested
certificate can be granted (for pending applications).  For final applications,
the requirements that were met.  Each entry is a dictionary with parameters
describing the requirement (see below).

certificate (optional, string):
: A URL for the certificate that has been issued in response to this
application.

  "expires": "2015-03-01T14:09:00Z",

[[ Open issue: There are two possible behaviors for the CA here.  Either (a) the
CA automatically issues once all the requirements are fulfilled, or (b) the CA
waits for confirmation from the client that it should issue.  If we allow both,
we will need a signal in the application object of whether confirmation is
required.  I would prefer that auto-issue be the default, which would imply a
syntax like "confirm": true ]]

[[ Open issue: Should this syntax allow multiple certificates?  That would
support reissuance / renewal in a straightforward way, especially if the CSR /
notBefore / notAfter could be updated. ]]

The elements of the "requirements" array are immutable once set, except for
their "status" fields.  If any other part of the object changes after the object
is created, the client MUST consider the application invalid.

The "requirements" array in the challenge SHOULD reflect everything that the CA
required the client to do before issuance, even if some requirements were
fulfilled in earlier applications.  For example, if a CA allows multiple
applications to be fufilled based on a single authorization transaction, then it
must reflect that authorization in all of the applications.

Each entry in the "requirements" array expresses a requirement from the CA for
the client to takek a particular action.  All requirements objects have the
following basic fields:

type (required, string):
: The type of requirement (see below for defined types)

status (required, string):
: The status of this requirement.  Possible values are: "pending", "valid", and
"invalid".

All additional fields are specified by the requirement type.

#### Authorization Requirement

A requirement with type "authorization" requests that the ACME client complete
an authorization transaction.  The server specifies the authorization by
pre-provisioning a pending authorization resource and providing the URI for this
resource in the requirement.

url (required, string):
: The URL for the authorization resource

To fulfill this requirement, the ACME client should fetch the authorization object
from the indicated URL, then follow the process for obtaining authorization as
specified in {{identifier-authorization}}.

#### Out-of-Band Requirement

A requirement with type "out-of-band" requests that the ACME client have a
human user visit a web page in order to receive further instructions for how to
fulfill the requirement.  The requirement object provides a URI for the web
page to be visited.

url (required, string):
: The URL to be visited.  The scheme of this URL MUST be "http" or "https"

To fulfill this requirement, the ACME client should direct the user to the
indicated web page.


### Authorization Objects

An ACME authorization object represents server's authorization for an account to
represent an identifier.  In addition to the identifier, an authorization
includes several metadata fields, such as the status of the authorization (e.g.,
"pending", "valid", or "revoked") and which challenges were used to validate
possession of the identifier.

The structure of an ACME authorization resource is as follows:

identifier (required, dictionary of string):
: The identifier that the account is authorized to represent

  type (required, string):
  : The type of identifier.

  value (required, string):
  : The identifier itself.

status (required, string):
: The status of this authorization.  Possible values are: "unknown", "pending",
"processing", "valid", "invalid" and "revoked".  If this field is missing, then
the default value is "pending".

expires (optional, string):
: The timestamp after which the server will consider this authorization invalid,
encoded in the format specified in RFC 3339 {{!RFC3339}}.  This field is REQUIRED
for objects with "valid" in the "status field.

scope (optional, string):
: If this field is present, then it MUST contain a URI for an application
resource, such that this authorization is only valid for that resource.  If this
field is absent, then the CA MUST consider this authorization valid for all
applications until the authorization expires. [[ Open issue: More flexible
scoping? ]]

challenges (required, array):
: The challenges that the client needs to fulfill
in order to prove possession of the identifier (for pending authorizations).
For final authorizations, the challenges that were used.  Each array entry is a
dictionary with parameters required to validate the challenge, as specified in
{{identifier-validation-challenges}}.

combinations (optional, array of arrays of integers):
: A collection of sets of
challenges, each of which would be sufficient to prove possession of the
identifier. Clients complete a set of challenges that covers at least one
set in this array. Challenges are identified by their indices in the challenges
array.  If no "combinations" element is included in an authorization object, the
client completes all challenges.

The only type of identifier defined by this specification is a fully-qualified
domain name (type: "dns").  The value of the identifier MUST be the ASCII
representation of the domain name.  Wildcard domain names (with "*" as the first
label) MUST NOT be included in authorization requests.

~~~~~~~~~~
{
  "status": "valid",
  "expires": "2015-03-01T14:09:00Z",

  "identifier": {
    "type": "dns",
    "value": "example.org"
  },

  "challenges": [
    {
      "type": "http-01",

      "keyAuthorization": "SXQe-2XODaDxNR...vb29HhjjLPSggwiE"
    }
  ]
}
~~~~~~~~~~


## Registration

A client creates a new account with the server by sending a POST request to the
server's new-registration URI.  The body of the request is a stub registration
object containing only the "contact" field.

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/new-reg HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "6S8IqOGY7eL2lsGoTZYifg",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/new-reg"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "contact": [
      "mailto:cert-admin@example.com",
      "tel:+12025551212"
    ]
  }),
  "signature": "RZPOnYoPs1PhjszF...-nh6X1qtOFPB519I"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The server MUST ignore any values provided in the "key", "authorizations", and
"certificates" fields in registration bodies sent by the client, as well as any
other fields that it does not recognize.  If new fields are specified in the
future, the specification of those fields MUST describe whether they may be
provided by the client.

The server creates a registration object with the included contact information.
The "key" element of the registration is set to the public key used to verify
the JWS (i.e., the "jwk" element of the JWS header).  The server returns this
registration object in a 201 (Created) response, with the registration URI in a
Location header field.

If the server already has a registration object with the provided account key,
then it MUST return a 409 (Conflict) response and provide the URI of that
registration in a Location header field.  This allows a client that has an
account key but not the corresponding registration URI to recover the
registration URI.

If the server wishes to present the client with terms under which the ACME
service is to be used, it MUST indicate the URI where such terms can be accessed
in a Link header with link relation "terms-of-service".  As noted above, the
client may indicate its agreement with these terms by updating its registration
to include the "agreement" field, with the terms URI as its value.  When these
terms change in a way that requires an agreement update, the server MUST
use a different URI in the Link header.

~~~~~~~~~~
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://example.com/acme/reg/asdf
Link: <https://example.com/acme/terms>;rel="terms-of-service"
Link: <https://example.com/acme/some-directory>;rel="directory"

{
  "key": { /* JWK from JWS header */ },
  "status": "good",

  "contact": [
    "mailto:cert-admin@example.com",
    "tel:+12025551212"
  ]
}
~~~~~~~~~~

If the client wishes to update this information in the future, it sends a POST
request with updated information to the registration URI.  The server MUST
ignore any updates to the "key", "authorizations, or "certificates" fields, and
MUST verify that the request is signed with the private key corresponding to the
"key" field of the request before updating the registration.

For example, to update the contact information in the above registration, the
client could send the following request:

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/reg/asdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "ax5RnthDqp_Yf4_HZnFLmA",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/reg/asdf"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "contact": [
      "mailto:certificates@example.com",
      "tel:+12125551212"
    ]
  }),
  "signature": "hDXzvcj8T6fbFbmn...rDzXzzvzpRy64N0o"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

Servers SHOULD NOT respond to GET requests for registration resources as these
requests are not authenticated.  If a client wishes to query the server for
information about its account (e.g., to examine the "contact" or "certificates"
fields), then it SHOULD do so by sending a POST request with an empty update.
That is, it should send a JWS whose payload is trivial ({}).

### Account Key Roll-over

A client may wish to change the public key that is associated with a
registration in order to recover from a key compromise or proactively mitigate
the impact of an unnoticed key compromise.

To change the key associated with an account, the client first constructs a
key-change object describing the change that it would like the server to make:

account (required, string):
: The URL for account being modified.  The content of this field MUST be the
exact string provided in the Location header field in response to the
new-registration request that created the account.

newKey (requrired, JWK):
: The JWK representation of the new key.

The client then encapsulates the key-change object in a JWS, signed with the
client's current account key.

This inner JWS then become the payload of the JWS that the client sends to the
server.  The outer JWS is signed with the key pair that the the client wishes to
have the server use as its account key (i.e., the key pair matching the "newKey"
value).  The client sends this outer JWS in a POST request to the server's
"key-change" resource.

The outer JWS MUST meet the normal requirements for an ACME JWS (see
{{request-authentication}}).  The inner JWS MUST meet the normal requirements,
with the following exceptions:

* The inner JWS MUST have the same "url" parameter as the outer JWS.
* The inner JWS is NOT REQUIRED to have a "nonce" parameter.  The server MUST
  ignore any value provided for the "nonce" header parameter.

This transaction has signatures from both the old and new keys so that the
server can verify that the holder of the current account key agrees to the
change, and possesses the new key.  The signatures are nested to preserve
the property that all signatures on POST messages are signed by exactly one
key.

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/key-change HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": /* new key */,
    "nonce": "K60BWPrMQG9SDxBDS_xtSw",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/key-change"
  }),
  "payload": base64url({
    "protected": base64url({
      "alg": "ES256",
      "jwk": /* old key */,
    }),
    "payload": base64url({
      "account": "https://example.com/acme/reg/asdf",
      "oldKey": "bHcFJ3p0fMo5I6Nu9uvx5Yat04ePLpe0UsA40nNyweg",
      "newKey": "Nyh_IpZjLIiAu_xm4Xp0Ac5Ckd1Gq1p-UtQjhMADCZI"
    })
    "signature": "Xe8B94RD30Azj2ea...8BmZIRtcSKPSd8gU"
  }),
  "signature": "5TWiqIYQfIDfALQv...x9C2mg8JGPxl5bI4"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

On receiving key-change request, the server MUST perform the following steps in
addition to the typical JWS validation:

1. Check that the payload of the JWS is a well-formed JWS object (the "inner
   JWS")
2. Check that the JWS protected header of the inner JWS has a "jwk" field
   containing a key that matches a currently active account
3. Check that the inner JWS verifies using the key in its "jwk" field
4. Check that the payload of the inner JWS is a well-formed key-change object
   (as described above)
5. Check that the "url" parameters of the inner and outer JWSs are the same
6. Check that the "account" field of the key-change object contains the URL for
   the registration matching the old key
7. Check that the "oldKey" field of the key-change object contains the
   thumbprint of the key used to sign the inner JWS
8. Check that the "newKey" field of the key-change object contains the
   thumbprint of the key used to sign the outer JWS

If all of these checks pass, then the server updates the corresponding
registration by replacing the old account key with the new public key and
returns status code 200. Otherwise, the server responds with an error status
code and a problem document describing the error.

### Account deactivation

A client may deactivate an account by posting a signed update to the server with
a status field of "deactivated." Clients may wish to do this when the account
key is compromised.

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/reg/asdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "ntuJWWSic4WVNSqeUmshgg",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/reg/asdf"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "status": "deactivated"
  }),
  "signature": "earzVLd3m5M4xJzR...bVTqn7R08AKOVf3Y"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The server MUST verify that the request is signed by the account key. If the
server accepts the deactivation request, it should reply with a 200 (OK) status
code and the current contents of the registration object.

Once an account is deactivated, the server MUST NOT accept further requests
authorized by that account's key. It is up to server policy how long to retain
data related to that account, whether to revoke certificates issued by that
account, and whether to send email to that account's contacts. ACME does not
provide a way to reactivate a deactivated account.

## Applying for Certificate Issuance

The holder of an account key pair may use ACME to submit an application for a
certificate to be issued.  The client makes this request by sending a POST
request to the server's new-application resource.  The body of the POST is a JWS
object whose JSON payload is a subset of the application object defined in
{{application-objects}}, containing the fields that describe the certificate to
be issued:

csr (required, string):
: A CSR encoding the parameters for the certificate being requested {{!RFC2986}}.
The CSR is sent in the Base64url-encoded version of the DER format.  (Note: This
field uses the same modified Base64 encoding rules used elsewhere in this
document, so it is different from PEM.)

notBefore (optional, string):
: The requested value of the notBefore field in the certificate, in the date
format defined in {{!RFC3339}}

notAfter (optional, string):
: The requested value of the notAfter field in the certificate, in the date
format defined in {{!RFC3339}}

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/new-app HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "5XJ1L3lEkMG7tR6pA00clA",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/new-app"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "csr": "5jNudRx6Ye4HzKEqT5...FS6aKdZeGsysoCo4H9P",
    "notBefore": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "notAfter": "2016-01-08T00:00:00Z"
  }),
  "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The CSR encodes the client's requests with regard to the content of the
certificate to be issued.  The CSR MUST indicate the requested identifiers,
either in the commonName portion of the requested subject name, or in an
extensionRequest attribute {{!RFC2985}} requesting a subjectAltName extension.

The server MUST return an error if it cannot fulfil the request as specified,
and MUST NOT issue a certificate with contents other than those requested.  If
the server requires the request to be modified in a certain way, it should
indicate the required changes using an appropriate error code and description.

If the server is willing to issue the requested certificate, it responds with a
201 (Created) response.  The body of this response is an application object
reflecting the client's request and any requirements the client must fulfill
before the certificate will be issued.

~~~~~~~~~~
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://example.com/acme/app/asdf

{
  "status": "pending",
  "expires": "2015-03-01T14:09:00Z",

  "csr": "jcRf4uXra7FGYW5ZMewvV...rhlnznwy8YbpMGqwidEXfE",
  "notBefore": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",

    },
    {
      "type": "out-of-band",
      "status": "pending",
      "url": "https://example.com/acme/payment/1234"
    }
  ]
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The application object returned by the server represents a promise that if the
client fulfills the server's requirements before the "expires" time, then the
server will issue the requested certificate.  In the application object, any
object in the "requirements" array whose status is "pending" represents an
action that the client must perform before the server will issue the
certificate.  If the client fails to complete the required actions before the
"expires" time, then the server SHOULD change the status of the application to
"invalid" and MAY delete the application resource.

The server SHOULD issue the requested certificate and update the application
resource with a URL for the certificate as soon as the client has fulfilled the
server's requirements.   If the client has already satisfied the server's
requirements at the time of this request (e.g., by obtaining authorization for
all of the identifiers in the certificate in previous transactions), then the
server MAY proactively issue the requested certificate and provide a URL for it
in the "certificate" field of the application.  The server MUST, however, still
list the satisfied requirements in the "requirements" array, with the state
"valid".

Once the client believes it has fulfilled the server's requirements, it should
send a GET request to the application resource to obtain its current state.  The
status of the application will indicate what action the client should take:

* "invalid": The certificate will not be issued.  Consider this application
  process abandoned.

* "pending": The server does not believe that the client has fulfilled the
  requirements.  Check the "requirements" array for requirements that are still
  pending.

* "processing": The server agrees that the requirements have been fulfilled, and
  is in the process of generating the certificate.  Retry after the time given
  in the "Retry-After" header field of the response, if any.

* "valid": The server has issued the certificate and provisioned its URL to the
  "certificate" field of the application.  Download the certificate.


### Downloading the Certificate

To download the issued certificate, the client simply sends a GET request to the
certificate URL.

The default format of the certificate is DER (application/pkix-cert).  The
client may request other formats by including an Accept header in its request.
For example, the client may use the media type application/x-pem-file to request
the certificate in PEM format.

The server provides metadata about the certificate in HTTP headers.  In
particular, the server MUST send one or more link relation header fields
{{RFC5988}} with relation "up", each indicating a single certificate resource
for the issuer of this certificate.  The server MAY also include the "up" links
from these resources to enable the client to build a full certificate chain.

The server MUST also provide a link relation header field with relation "author"
to indicate the application under which this certificate was issued.

If the CA participates in Certificate Transparency (CT) {{?RFC6962}}, then they
may want to provide the client with a Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) that
can be used to prove that a certificate was submitted to a CT log.  An SCT can
be included as an extension in the certificate or as an extension to OCSP
responses for the certificate.  The server can also provide the client with
direct access to an SCT for a certificate using a Link relation header field
with relation "ct-sct".

~~~~~~~~~~
GET /acme/cert/asdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/pkix-cert

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/pkix-cert
Link: <https://example.com/acme/ca-cert>;rel="up";title="issuer"
Link: <https://example.com/acme/revoke-cert>;rel="revoke"

Link: <https://example.com/acme/sct/asdf>;rel="ct-sct"
Link: <https://example.com/acme/some-directory>;rel="directory"

[DER-encoded certificate]
~~~~~~~~~~

A certificate resource represents a single, immutable certificate. If the client
wishes to obtain a renewed certificate, the client initiates a new application
process to request one.

Because certificate resources are immutable once issuance is complete, the
server MAY enable the caching of the resource by adding Expires and
Cache-Control headers specifying a point in time in the distant future. These
headers have no relation to the certificate's period of validity.

## Identifier Authorization

The identifier authorization process establishes the authorization of an account
to manage certificates for a given identifier.  This process must assure the
server of two things: First, that the client controls the private key of the
account key pair, and second, that the client holds the identifier in question.
This process may be repeated to associate multiple identifiers to a key pair
(e.g., to request certificates with multiple identifiers), or to associate
multiple accounts with an identifier (e.g., to allow multiple entities to manage
certificates).  The server may declare that an authorization is only valid for a
specific application by setting the "scope" field of the authorization to the
URI for that application.

Authorization resources are created by the server in response to certificate
applications submitted by an account key holder; their URLs are provided to the
client in "authorization" requirement objects.  The authorization object is
implicitly tied to the account key used to sign the new-application request.

When a client receives an application from the server with an "authorization"
requirement, it downloads the authorization resource by sending a GET request to

    }
  ],

}
~~~~~~~~~~

### Responding to Challenges

To prove control of the identifier and receive authorization, the client needs to
respond with information to complete the challenges.  To do this, the client
updates the authorization object received from the server by filling in any
required information in the elements of the "challenges" dictionary.  (This is
also the stage where the client should perform any actions required by the
challenge.)

The client sends these updates back to the server in the form of a JSON object
with the response fields required by the challenge type, carried in a POST
request to the challenge URI (not authorization URI).  This allows the client to
send information only for challenges it is responding to.

For example, if the client were to respond to the "http-01" challenge in the
above authorization, it would send the following request:

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/authz/asdf/0 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "Q_s3MWoqT05TrdkM2MTDcw",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/authz/asdf/0"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "type": "http-01",
    "keyAuthorization": "IlirfxKKXA...vb29HhjjLPSggwiE"
  }),
  "signature": "9cbg5JO1Gf5YLjjz...SpkUfcdPai9uVYYQ"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The server updates the authorization document by updating its representation of
the challenge with the response fields provided by the client.  The server MUST
ignore any fields in the response object that are not specified as response
fields for this type of challenge.  The server provides a 200 (OK) response
with the updated challenge object as its body.

If the client's response is invalid for some reason, or does not provide the
server with appropriate information to validate the challenge, then the server
MUST return an HTTP error.  On receiving such an error, the client SHOULD undo
any actions that have been taken to fulfill the challenge, e.g., removing files
that have been provisioned to a web server.

Presumably, the client's responses provide the server with enough information to
validate one or more challenges.  The server is said to "finalize" the
authorization when it has completed all the validations it is going to complete,
and assigns the authorization a status of "valid" or "invalid", corresponding to
whether it considers the account authorized for the identifier.  If the final
state is "valid", the server MUST add an "expires" field to the authorization.
When finalizing an authorization, the server MAY remove the "combinations" field
(if present) or remove any challenges still pending.  The server SHOULD NOT
remove challenges with status "invalid".

Usually, the validation process will take some time, so the client will need to
poll the authorization resource to see when it is finalized.  For challenges
where the client can tell when the server has validated the challenge (e.g., by
seeing an HTTP or DNS request from the server), the client SHOULD NOT begin
polling until it has seen the validation request from the server.

To check on the status of an authorization, the client sends a GET request to
the authorization URI, and the server responds with the current  authorization
object. In responding to poll requests while the validation is still in
progress, the server MUST return a 202 (Accepted) response, and MAY include a
Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the client.

~~~~~~~~~~
GET /acme/authz/asdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "status": "valid",
  "expires": "2015-03-01T14:09:00Z",

  "identifier": {
    "type": "dns",
    "value": "example.org"
  },

  "challenges": [
    {
      "type": "http-01"
      "status": "valid",
      "validated": "2014-12-01T12:05:00Z",
      "token": "IlirfxKKXAsHtmzK29Pj8A",
      "keyAuthorization": "IlirfxKKXA...vb29HhjjLPSggwiE"
    }
  ]
}
~~~~~~~~~~

### Deactivating an Authorization

If a client wishes to relinquish its authorization to issue certificates for an
identifier, then it may request that the server deactivate each authorization
associated with that identifier by sending a POST request with the static object
{"status": "deactivated"}.

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/authz/asdf HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "xWCM9lGbIyCgue8di6ueWQ",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/authz/asdf"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "status": "deactivated"
  }),
  "signature": "srX9Ji7Le9bjszhu...WTFdtujObzMtZcx4"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

The server MUST verify that the request is signed by the account key
corresponding to the account that owns the authorization. If the server accepts
the deactivation, it should reply with a 200 (OK) status code and the current
contents of the registration object.

The server MUST NOT treat deactivated authorization objects as sufficient for
issuing certificates.

## Certificate Revocation

To request that a certificate be revoked, the client sends a POST request to
the ACME server's revoke-cert URI.  The body of the POST is a JWS object whose
JSON payload contains the certificate to be revoked:

certificate (required, string):
: The certificate to be revoked, in the base64url-encoded version of the DER
format.  (Note: This field uses the same modified Base64 encoding rules used
elsewhere in this document, so it is different from PEM.)

reason (optional, int):
: One of the revocation reasonCodes defined in RFC 5280 {{RFC5280}} Section 5.3.1
to be used when generating OCSP responses and CRLs. If this field is not set
the server SHOULD use the unspecified (0) reasonCode value when generating OCSP
responses and CRLs. The server MAY disallow a subset of reasonCodes from being
used by the user.

~~~~~~~~~~
POST /acme/revoke-cert HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/jose+json

{
  "protected": base64url({
    "alg": "ES256",
    "jwk": {...},
    "nonce": "JHb54aT_KTXBWQOzGYkt9A",
    "url": "https://example.com/acme/revoke-cert"
  })
  "payload": base64url({
    "certificate": "MIIEDTCCAvegAwIBAgIRAP8...",
    "reason": 1
  }),
  "signature": "Q1bURgJoEslbD1c5...3pYdSMLio57mQNN4"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

Revocation requests are different from other ACME request in that they can be
signed either with an account key pair or the key pair in the certificate.
Before revoking a certificate, the server MUST verify that the key used to sign
the request is authorized to revoke the certificate.  The server SHOULD consider
at least the following keys authorized for a given certificate:

* the public key in the certificate.

* an account key that is authorized to act for all of the identifier(s) in the
  certificate.

If the revocation succeeds, the server responds with status code 200 (OK).  If
the revocation fails, the server returns an error.

~~~~~~~~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0

--- or ---

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

# Identifier Validation Challenges

There are few types of identifiers in the world for which there is a standardized
mechanism to prove possession of a given identifier.  In all practical cases,
CAs rely on a variety of means to test whether an entity applying for a
certificate with a given identifier actually controls that identifier.

Challenges provide the server with assurance that an account key holder is also
the entity that controls an identifier.  For each type of challenge, it must be
the case that in order for an entity to successfully complete the challenge the
entity must both:

* Hold the private key of the account key pair used to respond to the challenge
* Control the identifier in question

{{security-considerations}} documents how the challenges defined in this
document meet these requirements.  New challenges will need to document how they
do.

ACME uses an extensible challenge/response framework for identifier validation.
The server presents a set of challenges in the authorization object it sends to a
client (as objects in the "challenges" array), and the client responds by
sending a response object in a POST request to a challenge URI.

This section describes an initial set of challenge types.  Each challenge must
describe:

1. Content of challenge objects
2. Content of response objects
3. How the server uses the challenge and response to verify control of an
   identifier

Challenge objects all contain the following basic fields:

type (required, string):
: The type of challenge encoded in the object.

uri (required, string):
: The URI to which a response can be posted.

status (required, string):
: The status of this authorization.  Possible values are: "pending", "valid",
and "invalid".

validated (optional, string):
: The time at which this challenge was completed by the server, encoded in the
format specified in RFC 3339 {{RFC3339}}.  This field is REQUIRED if the
"status" field is "valid".

error (optional, dictionary of string):
: The error that occurred while the server was validating the challenge, if any.
This field is structured as a problem document
{{!RFC7807}}.

All additional fields are specified by the challenge type.  If the server sets a
challenge's "status" to "invalid", it SHOULD also include the "error" field to
help the client diagnose why they failed the challenge.

Different challenges allow the server to obtain proof of different aspects of
control over an identifier.  In some challenges, like HTTP and TLS SNI, the
client directly proves its ability to do certain things related to the
identifier.  The choice of which challenges to offer to a client under which
circumstances is a matter of server policy.

The identifier validation challenges described in this section all relate to
validation of domain names.  If ACME is extended in the future to support other
types of identifier, there will need to be new challenge types, and they will
need to specify which types of identifier they apply to.

[[ Editor's Note: In pre-RFC versions of this specification, challenges are
labeled by type, and with the version of the draft in which they were
introduced.  For example, if an HTTP challenge were introduced in version -03
and a breaking change made in version -05, then there would be a challenge
labeled "http-03" and one labeled "http-05" -- but not one labeled "http-04",
since challenge in version -04 was compatible with one in version -04. ]]

[[ Editor's Note: Operators SHOULD NOT issue "combinations" arrays in
authorization objects that require the client to perform multiple challenges
over the same type, e.g., ["http-03", "http-05"].  Challenges within a type are
testing the same capability of the domain owner, and it may not be possible to
satisfy both at once. ]]

## Key Authorizations

Several of the challenges in this document makes use of a key authorization
string.  A key authorization is a string that expresses a domain holder's
authorization for a specified key to satisfy a specified challenge, by
concatenating the token for the challenge with a key fingerprint, separated by a
"." character:

~~~~~~~~~~
key-authz = token || '.' || base64url(JWK\_Thumbprint(accountKey))
~~~~~~~~~~

The "JWK\_Thumbprint" step indicates the computation specified in {{!RFC7638}},
using the SHA-256 digest.  As specified in the individual challenges below, the
token for a challenge is a JSON string comprised entirely of characters in the
URL-safe Base64 alphabet.  The "||" operator indicates concatenation of strings.

In computations involving key authorizations, such as the digest computations
required for the DNS and TLS SNI challenges, the key authorization string MUST
be represented in UTF-8 form (or, equivalently, ASCII).

An example of how to compute a JWK thumbprint can be found in Section 3.1 of
{{!RFC7638}}.  Note that some cryptographic libraries prepend a zero octet to the
representation of the RSA public key parameters N and E, in order to avoid
ambiguity with regard to the sign of the number.  As noted in JWA {{!RFC7518}},
a JWK object MUST NOT include this zero octet.  That is, any initial zero octets
MUST be stripped before the values are base64url-encoded.

## HTTP

With HTTP validation, the client in an ACME transaction proves its control over
a domain name by proving that it can provision resources on an HTTP server that
responds for that domain name.  The ACME server challenges the client to
provision a file at a specific path, with a specific string as its content.

As a domain may resolve to multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, the server will
connect to at least one of the hosts found in A and AAAA records, at its
discretion.  Because many webservers allocate a default HTTPS virtual host to a
particular low-privilege tenant user in a subtle and non-intuitive manner, the
challenge must be completed over HTTP, not HTTPS.

type (required, string):
: The string "http-01"

token (required, string):
: A random value that uniquely identifies the challenge.  This value MUST have
at least 128 bits of entropy, in order to prevent an attacker from guessing it.
It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the URL-safe Base64 alphabet and MUST
NOT contain any padding characters ("=").

~~~~~~~~~~
{
  "type": "http-01",
  "token": "evaGxfADs6pSRb2LAv9IZf17Dt3juxGJ-PCt92wr-oA"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

A client responds to this challenge by constructing a key authorization from
the "token" value provided in the challenge and the client's account key.  The
client then provisions the key authorization as a resource on the HTTP server
for the domain in question.

The path at which the resource is provisioned is comprised of the fixed prefix
".well-known/acme-challenge/", followed by the "token" value in the challenge.
The value of the resource MUST be the ASCII representation of the key
authorization.

~~~~~~~~~~
.well-known/acme-challenge/evaGxfADs6pSRb2LAv9IZf17Dt3juxGJ-PCt92wr-oA
~~~~~~~~~~

The client's response to this challenge indicates its agreement to this
challenge by sending the server the key authorization covering the challenge's
token and the client's account key.  In addition, the client MAY advise the
server at which IP the challenge is provisioned.

keyAuthorization (required, string):
: The key authorization for this challenge.  This value MUST match the token
from the challenge and the client's account key.

~~~~~~~~~~
/* BEGIN JWS-signed content */
{
  "keyAuthorization": "evaGxfADs...62jcerQ"
}
/* END JWS-signed content */
~~~~~~~~~~

On receiving a response, the server MUST verify that the key authorization in
the response matches the "token" value in the challenge and the client's account
key.  If they do not match, then the server MUST return an HTTP error in
response to the POST request in which the client sent the challenge.

Given a challenge/response pair, the server verifies the client's control of the
domain by verifying that the resource was provisioned as expected.

1. Form a URI by populating the URI template {{!RFC6570}}
   "http://{domain}/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}", where:
  * the domain field is set to the domain name being verified; and
  * the token field is set to the token in the challenge.
2. Verify that the resulting URI is well-formed.
3. Dereference the URI using an HTTP GET request.
4. Verify that the body of the response is well-formed key authorization.  The
   server SHOULD ignore whitespace characters at the end of the body.
5. Verify that key authorization provided by the server matches the token for
   this challenge and the client's account key.

If all of the above verifications succeed, then the validation is successful.
If the request fails, or the body does not pass these checks, then it has
failed.

## TLS with Server Name Indication (TLS SNI)

The TLS with Server Name Indication (TLS SNI) validation method
proves control over a domain name by requiring the client to configure a TLS
server referenced by an A/AAAA record under the domain name to respond to
specific connection attempts utilizing the Server Name Indication extension
{{!RFC6066}}. The server verifies the client's challenge by accessing the
reconfigured server and verifying a particular challenge certificate is
presented.

type (required, string):
: The string "tls-sni-02"

token (required, string):
: A random value that uniquely identifies the challenge.  This value MUST have
at least 128 bits of entropy, in order to prevent an attacker from guessing it.
It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the URL-safe Base64 alphabet and MUST
NOT contain any padding characters ("=").

~~~~~~~~~~
{
  "type": "tls-sni-02",
  "token": "evaGxfADs6pSRb2LAv9IZf17Dt3juxGJ-PCt92wr-oA"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

A client responds to this challenge by constructing a self-signed certificate
which the client MUST provision at the domain name concerned in order to pass
the challenge.

The certificate may be constructed arbitrarily, except that each certificate
MUST have exactly two subjectAlternativeNames, SAN A and SAN B. Both MUST be
dNSNames.

SAN A MUST be constructed as follows: compute the SHA-256 digest of the
UTF-8-encoded challenge token and encode it in lowercase hexadecimal form.  The
dNSName is "x.y.token.acme.invalid", where x is the first half of the
hexadecimal representation and y is the second half.

SAN B MUST be constructed as follows: compute the SHA-256 digest of
the UTF-8 encoded key authorization and encode it in lowercase hexadecimal
form. The dNSName is "x.y.ka.acme.invalid" where x is the first half of the
hexadecimal representation and y is the second half.

The client MUST ensure that the certificate is served to TLS connections
specifying a Server Name Indication (SNI) value of SAN A.

The response to the TLS-SNI challenge simply acknowledges that the client is
ready to fulfill this challenge.

keyAuthorization (required, string):
: The key authorization for this challenge.  This value MUST match the token
from the challenge and the client's account key.

~~~~~~~~~~
/* BEGIN JWS-signed content */
{
  "keyAuthorization": "evaGxfADs...62jcerQ"
}
/* END JWS-signed content */
~~~~~~~~~~

On receiving a response, the server MUST verify that the key authorization in
the response matches the "token" value in the challenge and the client's account
key.  If they do not match, then the server MUST return an HTTP error in
response to the POST request in which the client sent the challenge.

Given a challenge/response pair, the ACME server verifies the client's control
of the domain by verifying that the TLS server was configured appropriately,
using these steps:

1. Compute SAN A and SAN B in the same way as the client.
2. Open a TLS connection to the domain name being validated on the requested
   port, presenting SAN A in the SNI field.  In the ClientHello initiating the
   TLS handshake, the server MUST include a server\_name extension (i.e., SNI)
   containing SAN A. The server SHOULD ensure that it does not reveal SAN B in
   any way when making the TLS connection, such that the presentation of SAN B
   in the returned certificate proves association with the client.
3. Verify that the certificate contains a subjectAltName extension containing
   dNSName entries of SAN A and SAN B and no other entries.
   The comparison MUST be insensitive to case and ordering of names.

It is RECOMMENDED that the ACME server validation TLS connections from multiple
vantage points to reduce the risk of DNS hijacking attacks.

If all of the above verifications succeed, then the validation is successful.
Otherwise, the validation fails.

## DNS

When the identifier being validated is a domain name, the client can prove
control of that domain by provisioning a resource record under it.   The DNS
challenge requires the client to provision a TXT record containing a designated
value under a specific validation domain name.

type (required, string):
: The string "dns-01"

token (required, string):
: A random value that uniquely identifies the challenge.  This value MUST have
at least 128 bits of entropy, in order to prevent an attacker from guessing it.
It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the URL-safe Base64 alphabet and MUST
NOT contain any padding characters ("=").

~~~~~~~~~~
{
  "type": "dns-01",
  "token": "evaGxfADs6pSRb2LAv9IZf17Dt3juxGJ-PCt92wr-oA"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

A client responds to this challenge by constructing a key authorization from the
"token" value provided in the challenge and the client's account key.  The
client then computes the SHA-256 digest of the key authorization.

The record provisioned to the DNS is the base64url encoding of this digest.  The
client constructs the validation domain name by prepending the label
"_acme-challenge" to the domain name being validated, then provisions a TXT
record with the digest value under that name. For example, if the domain name
being validated is "example.com", then the client would provision the following
DNS record:

~~~~~~~~~~
_acme-challenge.example.com. 300 IN TXT "gfj9Xq...Rg85nM"
~~~~~~~~~~

The response to the DNS challenge provides the computed key authorization to
acknowledge that the client is ready to fulfill this challenge.

keyAuthorization (required, string):
: The key authorization for this challenge.  This value MUST match the token
from the challenge and the client's account key.

~~~~~~~~~~
/* BEGIN JWS-signed content */
{
  "keyAuthorization": "evaGxfADs...62jcerQ"
}
/* END JWS-signed content */
~~~~~~~~~~

On receiving a response, the server MUST verify that the key authorization in
the response matches the "token" value in the challenge and the client's account
key.  If they do not match, then the server MUST return an HTTP error in
response to the POST request in which the client sent the challenge.

To validate a DNS challenge, the server performs the following steps:

1. Compute the SHA-256 digest of the key authorization
2. Query for TXT records under the validation domain name
3. Verify that the contents of one of the TXT records matches the digest value

If all of the above verifications succeed, then the validation is successful.
If no DNS record is found, or DNS record and response payload do not pass these
checks, then the validation fails.

## Out-of-Band

There may be cases where a server cannot perform automated validation of an
identifier, for example if validation requires some manual steps.  In such
cases, the server may provide an "out of band" (OOB) challenge to request that
the client perform some action outside of ACME in order to validate possession
of the identifier.

The OOB challenge requests that the client have a human user visit a web page to
receive instructions on how to validate possession of the identifier, by
providing a URL for that web page.

type (required, string):
: The string "oob-01"

url (required, string):
: The URL to be visited.  The scheme of this URL MUST be "http" or "https"

~~~~~~~~~~
{
  "type": "oob-01",
  "url": "https://example.com/validate/evaGxfADs6pSRb2LAv9IZ"
}
~~~~~~~~~~

A client responds to this challenge by presenting the indicated URL for a human
user to navigate to.  If the user choses to complete this challege (by vising
the website and completing its instructions), the client indicates this by
sending a simple acknowledgement response to the server.

type (required, string):
: The string "oob-01"

~~~~~~~~~~
/* BEGIN JWS-signed content */
{
  "type": "oob-01"
}
/* END JWS-signed content */
~~~~~~~~~~

On receiving a response, the server MUST verify that the value of the "type"
field is as required.  Otherwise, the steps the server takes to validate
identifier possession are determined by the server's local policy.

# Security Considerations

ACME is a protocol for managing certificates that attest to identifier/key
bindings.  Thus the foremost security goal of ACME is to ensure the integrity of
this process, i.e., to ensure that the bindings attested by certificates are
correct, and that only authorized entities can manage certificates.  ACME
identifies clients by their account keys, so this overall goal breaks down into
two more precise goals:

1. Only an entity that controls an identifier can get an account key authorized
   for that identifier
2. Once authorized, an account key's authorizations cannot be improperly
   transferred to another account key

In this section, we discuss the threat model that underlies ACME and the ways
that ACME achieves these security goals within that threat model.  We also
discuss the denial-of-service risks that ACME servers face, and a few other
miscellaneous considerations.

## Threat model

As a service on the Internet, ACME broadly exists within the Internet threat
model {{?RFC3552}}.  In analyzing ACME, it is useful to think of an ACME server
interacting with other Internet hosts along three "channels":

* An ACME channel, over which the ACME HTTPS requests are exchanged
* A validation channel, over which the ACME server performs additional requests
  to validate a client's control of an identifier
* A contact channel, over which the ACME server sends messages to the registered
  contacts for ACME clients

~~~~~~~~~~
+------------+
|    ACME    |     ACME Channel
|   Client   |--------------------+
+------------+                    |
       ^                          V
       |   Contact Channel  +------------+
       +--------------------|    ACME    |
                            |   Server   |
                            +------------+
+------------+                    |
| Validation |<-------------------+
|   Server   |  Validation Channel
+------------+
~~~~~~~~~~

In practice, the risks to these channels are not entirely separate, but they are
different in most cases.  Each of the three channels, for example, uses a
different communications pattern: the ACME channel will comprise inbound HTTPS
connections to the ACME server, the validation channel outbound HTTP or DNS
requests, and the contact channel will use channels such as email and PSTN.

Broadly speaking, ACME aims to be secure against active and passive attackers on
any individual channel.  Some vulnerabilities arise (noted below), when an
attacker can exploit both the ACME channel and one of the others.

On the ACME channel, in addition to network-layer attackers, we also need to
account for application-layer man in the middle attacks, and for abusive use of
the protocol itself.  Protection against application-layer MitM addresses
potential attackers such as Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) and middleboxes
with a TLS MitM function.  Preventing abusive use of ACME means ensuring that an
attacker with access to the validation or contact channels can't obtain
illegitimate authorization by acting as an ACME client (legitimately, in terms
of the protocol).

## Integrity of Authorizations

ACME allows anyone to request challenges for an identifier by registering an
account key and sending a new-application request under that account key.  The
integrity of the authorization process thus depends on the identifier validation
challenges to ensure that the challenge can only be completed by someone who
both (1) holds the private key of the account key pair, and (2) controls the
identifier in question.

Validation responses need to be bound to an account key pair in order to avoid
situations where an ACME MitM can switch out a legitimate domain holder's
account key for one of his choosing, e.g.:

* Legitimate domain holder registers account key pair A
* MitM registers account key pair B
* Legitimate domain holder sends a new-application request signed under
  account key A
* MitM suppresses the legitimate request, but sends the same request signed
  under account key B
* ACME server issues challenges and MitM forwards them to the legitimate domain
  holder
* Legitimate domain holder provisions the validation response
* ACME server performs validation query and sees the response provisioned by the
  legitimate domain holder
* Because the challenges were issued in response to a message signed account key
  B, the ACME server grants authorization to account key B (the MitM) instead of
  account key A (the legitimate domain holder)

All of the challenges above have a binding between the account private key and
the validation query made by the server, via the key authorization.  The key
authorization is signed by the account private key, reflects the corresponding
public key, and is provided to the server in the validation response.

The association of challenges to identifiers is typically done by requiring the
client to perform some action that only someone who effectively controls the
identifier can perform.  For the challenges in this document, the actions are:

* HTTP: Provision files under .well-known on a web server for the domain
* TLS SNI: Configure a TLS server for the domain
* DNS: Provision DNS resource records for the domain

There are several ways that these assumptions can be violated, both by
misconfiguration and by attack.  For example, on a web server that allows
non-administrative users to write to .well-known, any user can claim to own the
server's hostname by responding to an HTTP challenge, and likewise for TLS
configuration and TLS SNI.

The use of hosting providers is a particular risk for ACME validation.  If the
owner of the domain has outsourced operation of DNS or web services to a hosting
provider, there is nothing that can be done against tampering by the hosting
provider.  As far as the outside world is concerned, the zone or web site
provided by the hosting provider is the real thing.

More limited forms of delegation can also lead to an unintended party gaining
the ability to successfully complete a validation transaction.  For example,
suppose an ACME server follows HTTP redirects in HTTP validation and a
web site operator provisions a catch-all redirect rule that redirects requests
for unknown resources to a different domain.  Then the target of the redirect
could use that to get a certificate through HTTP validation, since the
validation path will not be known to the primary server.

The DNS is a common point of vulnerability for all of these challenges.  An
entity that can provision false DNS records for a domain can attack the DNS
challenge directly, and can provision false A/AAAA records to direct the ACME
server to send its TLS SNI or HTTP validation query to a server of the
attacker's choosing.  There are a few different mitigations that ACME servers
can apply:

* Always querying the DNS using a DNSSEC-validating resolver (enhancing
  security for zones that are DNSSEC-enabled)
* Querying the DNS from multiple vantage points to address local attackers
* Applying mitigations against DNS off-path attackers, e.g., adding entropy to
  requests {{?I-D.vixie-dnsext-dns0x20}} or only using TCP

Given these considerations, the ACME validation process makes it impossible for
any attacker on the ACME channel, or a passive attacker on the validation
channel to hijack the authorization process to authorize a key of the attacker's
choice.

An attacker that can only see the ACME channel would need to convince the
validation server to provide a response that would authorize the attacker's
account key, but this is prevented by binding the validation response to the
account key used to request challenges.  A passive attacker on the validation
channel can observe the correct validation response and even replay it, but that
response can only be used with the account key for which it was generated.

An active attacker on the validation channel can subvert the ACME process, by
performing normal ACME transactions and providing a validation response for his
own account key.  The risks due to hosting providers noted above are a
particular case.  For identifiers where the server already has some public key
associated with the domain this attack can be prevented by requiring the client
to prove control of the corresponding private key.

## Denial-of-Service Considerations

As a protocol run over HTTPS, standard considerations for TCP-based and
HTTP-based DoS mitigation also apply to ACME.

At the application layer, ACME requires the server to perform a few potentially
expensive operations.  Identifier validation transactions require the ACME
server to make outbound connections to potentially attacker-controlled servers,
and certificate issuance can require interactions with cryptographic hardware.

In addition, an attacker can also cause the ACME server to send validation
requests to a domain of its choosing by submitting authorization requests for
the victim domain.

All of these attacks can be mitigated by the application of appropriate rate
limits.  Issues closer to the front end, like POST body validation, can be
addressed using HTTP request limiting.  For validation and certificate requests,
there are other identifiers on which rate limits can be keyed.  For example, the
server might limit the rate at which any individual account key can issue
certificates, or the rate at which validation can be requested within a given
subtree of the DNS.

## Server-Side Request Forgery

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks can arise when an attacker can cause
a server to perform HTTP requests to an attacker-chosen URL.  In the ACME HTTP
challenge validation process, the ACME server performs an HTTP GET request to a
URL in which the attacker can choose the domain.  This request is made before
the server has verified that the client controls the domain, so any client can
cause a query to any domain.

Some server implementations include information from the validation server's
response (in order to facilitate debugging).  Such implementations enable an
attacker to extract this information from any web server that is accessible to
the ACME server, even if it is not accessible to the ACME client.

It might seem that the risk of SSRF through this channel is limited by the fact
that the attacker can only control the domain of the URL, not the path.
However, if the attacker first sets the domain to one they control, then they
can send the server an HTTP redirect (e.g., a 302 response) which will cause the
server to query an arbitrary URI.

In order to further limit the SSRF risk, ACME server operators should ensure
that validation queries can only be sent to servers on the public Internet, and
not, say, web services within the server operator's internal network.  Since the
attacker could make requests to these public servers himself, he can't gain
anything extra through an SSRF attack on ACME aside from a layer of
anonymization.

## CA Policy Considerations

The controls on issuance enabled by ACME are focused on validating that a
certificate applicant controls the identifier he claims.  Before issuing a
certificate, however, there are many other checks that a CA might need to
perform, for example:

* Has the client agreed to a subscriber agreement?
* Is the claimed identifier syntactically valid?
* For domain names:
  * If the leftmost label is a '*', then have the appropriate checks been
    applied?
  * Is the name on the Public Suffix List?
  * Is the name a high-value name?
  * Is the name a known phishing domain?
* Is the key in the CSR sufficiently strong?
* Is the CSR signed with an acceptable algorithm?

CAs that use ACME to automate issuance will need to ensure that their servers
perform all necessary checks before issuing.

# Operational Considerations

There are certain factors that arise in operational reality that operators of
ACME-based CAs will need to keep in mind when configuring their services.
For example:

## DNS over TCP

As noted above, DNS forgery attacks against the ACME server can result in the
server making incorrect decisions about domain control and thus mis-issuing
certificates.  Servers SHOULD verify DNSSEC when it is available for a domain.
When DNSSEC is not available, servers SHOULD perform DNS queries over TCP, which
provides better resistance to some forgery attacks than DNS over UDP.

## Default Virtual Hosts

In many cases, TLS-based services are deployed on hosted platforms that use
the Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS extension to distinguish between
different hosted services or "virtual hosts".  When a client initiates a
TLS connection with an SNI value indicating a provisioned host, the hosting
platform routes the connection to that host.

When a connection comes in with an unknown SNI value, one might expect the
hosting platform to terminate the TLS connection.  However, some hosting
platforms will choose a virtual host to be the "default", and route connections
with unknown SNI values to that host.

In such cases, the owner of the default virtual host can complete a TLS-based
challenge (e.g., "tls-sni-02") for any domain with an A record that points to
the hosting platform.  This could result in mis-issuance in cases where there
are multiple hosts with different owners resident on the hosting platform.

A CA that accepts TLS-based proof of domain control should attempt to check
whether a domain is hosted on a domain with a default virtual host before
allowing an authorization request for this host to use a TLS-based challenge.
A default virtual host can be detected by initiating TLS connections to the host
with random SNI values within the namespace used for the TLS-based challenge
(the "acme.invalid" namespace for "tls-sni-02").

## Use of DNSSEC Resolvers

An ACME-based CA will often need to make DNS queries, e.g., to validate control
of DNS names.  Because the security of such validations ultimately depends on
the authenticity of DNS data, every possible precaution should be taken to
secure DNS queries done by the CA. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that ACME-based
CAs make all DNS queries via DNSSEC-validating stub or recursive resolvers. This
provides additional protection to domains which choose to make use of DNSSEC.

An ACME-based CA must use only a resolver if it trusts the resolver and every
component of the network route by which it is accessed. It is therefore
RECOMMENDED that ACME-based CAs operate their own DNSSEC-validating resolvers
within their trusted network and use these resolvers both for both CAA record
lookups and all record lookups in furtherance of a challenge scheme (A, AAAA,
TXT, etc.).
